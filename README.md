# Codewars Solutions in C#

This repository contains my solutions to various Codewars coding challenges implemented in C#.

## Overview

The repository is a collection of algorithm problems and their solutions, primarily focused on:
- String manipulation
- Mathematical operations
- Bit manipulation
- Regular expressions
- Algorithm implementation

## Challenge Solutions

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [RegexValidatePinCode](RegexValidatePinCode.cs) | Validates if a PIN code contains exactly 4 or 6 digits |
| [SquareEveryDigit](SquareEveryDigit.cs) | Squares every digit in a number and concatenates them |
| [SplitStrings](SplitStrings.cs) | Splits strings into pairs of characters |
| [OnesandZeros](OnesandZeros.cs) | Converts binary array to decimal integer |
| [Digital_Root](Digital_Root.cs) | Calculates the recursive sum of digits until a single digit remains |
| [BitCounting](BitCounting.cs) | Counts '1' bits in binary representation of a number |
| [BreakCamelCase](BreakCamelCase.cs) | Inserts spaces between words in camel case strings |
| [CountingDuplicates](CountingDuplicates.cs) | Counts characters that appear more than once in a string |

## How to Run

Each solution class contains a static `Solution` method that can be tested through the `MainProgram.cs` file.

To run the solutions:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio
3. Run the project to see the test cases in action
